Difference between Window and Document Object.
Window Object:
It is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy.
It is the global object in the web browser environment.
It represents the current browser window or frames that displays the contents of the webpage.
Whenever a window apppears on the screen to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.
If a document contains frames, the browser creates one window object for the HTML document and one additional object for each frame.
Syntax: window.property_name;


Document Object:
It is a property of the window object.
It represents the current web page in the browser window or the HTML document that is loaded in the browser.
By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page and manipulate the structure, content and styling using the DOM (Document Object Model)
With the help of the document objects, we can add dynamic content to the web page.
The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
Syntax:document.property_name;
